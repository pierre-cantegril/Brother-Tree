# Brother-Tree
Python script to generate and render a dot file using Python and the graphviz module. The script uses an Excel spreadsheet that must contain all the necessary information (member, big, pledging session). In the case of members whose big is unknown, the script will generate a sub-graph on the side with these brothers.

# New to Python ? 
Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (you should certainly use the latest Python version in 64 bits). Start the programm `Anaconda Prompt` and run the command `conda install graphviz python-graphviz` to install the module `graphviz`. Then, run the command `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` to start having fun ;)
